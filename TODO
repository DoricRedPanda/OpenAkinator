There are some ideas for improvement ranged by importence/difficulty:
1) Use logarithms to save multiplications. Hence, improve performance.
2) Lock files to run multiple instances of the program simultaniously.
3) Improve database. Maybe something like sqllite?
4) Add GUI, maybe multiple variants.
